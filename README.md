# RGSS Scripts
Scripts for use with the RPG Maker software

## Terms of Use
These terms of use can also be found in the header of each script. The ToU in some scripts may differ from the one displayed here. In this case, the ToU found in the scripts is binding. By using any of the scripts found here, you agree to the Terms of Use of said scripts.

>This script may be used freely for non-commercial purposes only. Explicit permission must be granted for commercial use. You can contact eposofcrystal@gmail.com to request permission. In all cases, commercial or non-commercial, proper credit needs to be given to Karanum. Redistribution outside of RPG Maker games is not allowed; please link to https://github.com/Karanum/RGSS-Scripts instead.

Even if you take any of these scripts for private use, a short notice (and maybe a copy of your game? Hint, hint) would be appreciated, but in no way mandatory.

NOTE: If you update to a newer version of a script, you will automatically agree to the new Terms of Use if they have been updated for that script. Make sure to re-read them, just in case.

## Installation
For all these scripts, the method of installation is fairly simple.
Open up the Script Editor in the corresponding RM version, right-click an empty script name just above Main and select Insert. Enter any script name, then copy the entirety of a script and paste it there.

Most scripts have some configuration options that need to be set. All scripts posted here will have comments at the config lines that tell you what it is for and what it should be set to.
If you cannot figure out how to make it work, feel free to contact me for support. (Contact info below)
